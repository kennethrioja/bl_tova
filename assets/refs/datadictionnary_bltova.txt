----------------------------------------------------------------
rt
	int array
	rt's from all reponses during the soa
response
	string array
	array containing the keys pressed for each trial (restricted to space bar, see 'choices' in bl_tova.js)
accuracy
	string array
	NA : used for 'survey' trial_type, see below
trial_type
	string
	The name of the plugin used to run the trial (https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins)
trial_index
	int
	THIS IS NOT THE REAL  TRIAL INDEX it is the index of the current trial across the whole experiment (https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins)
time_elapsed
	int
	The number of milliseconds between the start of the experiment and when the trial ended. (https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins)
internal_node_id
	string
	A string identifier for the current TimelineNode. (https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/overview/plugins/#data-collected-by-all-plugins)
real_trial_index
	int
	created manually - (find '*MODIFIED*' in jspsych.js), real trials are begining with 1, 0 are the pluggins â€“ if the participant has done multiple practice blocks, then there should be a 1 and a 2 lying there, do not take it into account. During data cleaning, filter by block and you should have it all ordered by block (from 1 to n_trial).
subject_id
	string
	Subject ID, whether taken from the URL or manually if `ask_for_id = true`
study_id
	string
	Study ID, whether taken from the URL or manually if `ask_for_id = true`
session_id
	string
	Session ID, whether taken from the URL or manually if `ask_for_id = true`
presentation_time
	int
	Time in miliseconds elapsed between the onset of the stimulus i and the offset of the stimulus i
soa
	int
	Stimulus onset asynchrony, time in miliseconds elapsed between the onset of the stimulus i and the onset of the stimulus i + 1. soa = presentation_time + reaction time (RT not present in the variables here, but you can compute it obviously). Varies between 250ms and 4100ms.
monitorsize_inch
	double
	Screen diagonal size in inch, manually provided in the global variables or taken through calibration (that you must implement yourself).
pxperdeg
	int
	Pixel per degree, manually provided in the global variables or taken through calibration (that you must implement yourself).
stimulus_diagonal_px
	double
	Virtual size in pixels of the stimulus on screen, computed with monitorsize_inch and pxperdeg.
stimulus_diagonal_cm
	double
	Physical size in cm of the stimulus on screen, computed with monitorsize_inch and pxperdeg.
success, timeout, failed_images, failed_audio, failed_video
	string array
	NA : used for 'preload' and 'fullscreen' trial_type, see below
width, height, browser, browser_version, mobile, os, fullscreen, vsync_rate, view_history
	...
	https://www.jspsych.org/7.2/plugins/browser-check/#data-generated
stimulus
	string
	label of the stimulus ('shapeup' or 'shapedown'), see 'stimulus_label' in bl_tova.js
block
	string
	block name : practice | sa = sustained attention | ic = inhibitory control, see 'block_type' in bl_tova.js
condition
	string
	condition : Go = target, NoGo = non-target
position_is_top
	int
	position of the stimulus during presentation_time : 1 = stimulus image displayed at the top of the screen, 0 = stimulus image displayed at the bottom of the screen
effective_response
	int
	participant's response : 0 = refrained, 1 = pressed spacebar, 2 = pressed spacebar multiple times
correct
	int
	whether the trial was correct (1) or incorrect (0)
trial_accuracy
	string
	trial outcome (expected x effective) can have those values : "correct rejection", 'miss', "false alarm", 'hit'
